* Usage
#OPT: id=Usage
#LIST fmt=html plain! sub!: toc

The command-line options:

#Ruby verb! wrap=60 <<---
`DeplateOptions="vanilla" deplate --help`
---

Typical uses of ''deplate'' are:

    deplate -D auxiliaryDirSuffix=_files text.txt :: Convert the file to html; 
      put auxiliary files that are created during the conversion process into 
      a subdirectory called "text_files"
    deplate -d DESTDIR -f htmlslides text*.txt :: Convert a bunch of files to 
      "html slides"; put the output into "DESTDIR"
    deplate -f latex --pdf -D suffix=txt text*.txt :: Convert a bunch of files 
      to a single LaTeX file and prepare for pdflatex; assume that the wiki 
      files have a "txt" extension; wiki names referring to included files are 
      transformed to internal references
    deplate -R -p '\\*.txt' -D suffix=txt -o ../Wiki.tex  \WikiIndex.txt * :: 
      Convert all files in the current directory and below to a single LaTeX 
      file; include only files with "txt" as suffix; put ''WikiIndex.txt'' 
      first
    deplate -R -e -d ../Wiki_html * :: Convert all files in the current 
      directory and its subdirectories to html; save the output in directory 
      ''Wiki_html''; rebuild the directory structure of the input files
    deplate - < INPUT > OUTPUT :: Work as a filter by converting the input 
      from stdin; this doesn't actually work like a pipe though because all 
      the input has to be read in order to generate the output
    deplate -x -X file.txt :: Convert a file and allow the evaluation of 
      embedded ruby code and the execution of external applications, e.g.,
      latex. These command switches are necessary for some language elements 
      to work.
      #IDX: allow
    % deplate -m xmlrpc - :: work as a xmlrpc server

Notes:

    -D VAR, -D VAR=VALUE :: 
      You can define document variables via the command line; if no 
      value is provided the variable is set to "1".
        #commandLineOptionD

      The option parser library, which ''deplate'' uses, doesn't deal well 
      with spaces in command line arguments. This is why spaces have to 
      be replaced with tildes; a tilde and backslashes have to be 
      preceded with backslashes. Example: ''-D text=bla~bla\\~bla'' sets 
      the document variable ''text'' to "bla bla~bla". As a shell usually 
      interpretes backslashes too, you would usually have to type ''-D 
      text=bla~bla\\\\~bla''.

    -e :: 
      Process each file separately

    -m, -\-module MODULE :: Load an add-on/module (after loading the 
      core and the formatter); modules reside in the deplate library 
      directory or in the user configuration directory 
      ("~/.deplate/mod/"); type ''deplate --help'' to see a list of 
      available modules.

      After loading the module, deplate searches for the file 
      "~/.deplate/after/mod/NAME.rb" which will be loaded if found.

      German, Chinese, and Russian localizations are provided as 
      modules.

    -p PATTERN, -P PATTERN :: Backslashes in the pattern must come in 
      doubles; backslashes can be used to prevent the shell from 
      expanding the pattern; e.g., in case you're using bash, you would 
      usually type something like ''-p "\\\\*.txt"''

    --theme THEME :: See{ref: theme}.

    -x, -\-allow-ruby [RUBY SAFE] :: 
      Ruby's SAFE variable has 5 levels (0=no checks/default .. 
      4=sandbox; at present, this also sets the SAFE variable for 
      ''deplate'' itself, which doesn't work with SAFE set to 4)

    -X, --[no-]allow-exec, --[no-]external :: Allow the execution of external 
      applications, e.g., LaTeX. You won't be able to translate inline LaTeX 
      unless you call ''deplate'' with this command line option. In order to 
      make this permanent{text if=(manPage!=1):, see{ref: user_setup}}.

    -A, --allow FLAGS :: Flags is a list of comma separated letters which may 
      contain{lab: allow}:
        all :: Unsafe mode; allow everything
        l :: Allow the ''#LANG'' command to automatically load a module of the 
          language's name (this would make it possible for a malicious user to 
          load any module as deplate cannot distinguish localization modules 
          from other modules)
        r :: Check files in ''$PWD/deplate.rc''{idx: deplate.rc} in some cases 
          (e.g. check for a local config.rb{idx: config.rb}); templates, css 
          files, and library snippets are always searched in the 
          ''deplate.rc''{idx: deplate.rc} directory too; if you want to allow 
          a ''deplate.ini''{idx: deplate.ini} file in this directory, you have 
          the add ''allow r'' to your private deplate.ini file (usually in 
          ''~/.deplate/'')
        s :: Load ''{theme}/theme.ini'' if any (this might be necessary for 
          most themes to be fully functional)
        t :: Unfiltered (La)TeX
        w :: Enable the ''#Write'' region (directory local file names only)
        W :: Enable the ''#Write'' region (allow relative & absolute file 
          names)
        x :: Same as -x
        X :: Same as -X
        . :: Allow sending methods to objects in the ''arg'' macro{text 
          if=manPage!=1: (see{ref: argMacro})} and friends.
        : :: Allow referencing options by prepending a name with ":" in some 
          situations (e.g. #IF tests).
      You can remove the permission to do something by prepending a minus to 
      the flag, e.g. by setting ''--allow -x'' on the command line after 
      having allowed ''x'' in the deplate.ini file.

Some variables change the way ''deplate'' works.

    autoFileNames :: {idx: autoFileNames} In multi-file output, the file name 
      is constructed from the top heading unless explicitely defined (id, 
      caption, shortcaption)

    auxiliaryDirSuffix :: {idx: auxiliaryDirSuffix} If defined, auxiliary 
      files are saved in the subdirectory ''#{basename 
      FILENAME}#{auxiliaryDirSuffix}''. E.g., if ''auxiliaryDirSuffix'' is 
      "_files" and the current file is "Test", then auxiliary files (images, 
      on-the-fly generated files that are passed to external applications 
      etc.) are saved in "Test_files".      

#IF: manPage!=1
If you are a ruby programmer, you can also use ''deplate'' as a library 
for formatting strings. You could use the convenience classes 
''Deplate::Converter'' or ''DeplateString'' for this.

#EXAMPLE: Using the Deplate::Converter class

#Code id=converter syntax=ruby <<---
require 'deplate/converter'

t = <<EOF
* Introduction

''deplate'' is a tool for converting wiki-like markup to latex, html, or 
"html-slides".
EOF

to_html = Deplate::Converter.new
puts to_html.convert_string(t)

to_latex = Deplate::Converter.new("latex")
puts to_latex.convert_string(t)
---

or:

#Code id=deplatestring syntax=ruby <<---
require 'deplate/deplate-string'

t = <<EOF
* Introduction

''deplate'' is a tool for converting wiki-like markup to latex, html, or 
"html-slides".
EOF

puts DeplateString.new(t).to_html
---

The ''DeplateString'' is probably easier to use from within other programs 
like e.g. Nukumi2{text if=(manPage!=1): \ (see{ref: nukumi2})}.
#ENDIF: manPage


** Editor support
*** General remark
As whitespace is significant in the context of lists and the like, you should 
not insert tab characters in the document but replace tabs with blanks/spaces. 
Most editors can be tweaked to work this way.

If you absolutely want to insert tab characters or if you don't know how to 
keep your editor from inserting tabs, you can set the ''tabwidth'' (default: 
4) variable to the tab width setting of your editor. ''deplate'' will then try 
to expand tab characters.

*** VIM
''deplate'' is the accompanying converter for the 
[[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=861][Vim viki plugin]], 
which supports all of ''deplate'''s default markup.


* Configuration
#OPT: id=Configuration
#LIST fmt=html plain! sub!: toc

Configuration requires some knowledge of the ruby language. If you don't 
already know ruby, ruby is a well designed, __fully__ object-oriented 
interpreted language in the spirit of Smalltalk (but with a rather 
modern syntax) plus some features from Perl and Lisp/Scheme (e.g.  
continuations).

The configuration files are regular ruby files and are loaded after requiring 
all the libraries necessary. Theses files reside in the directory 
"$HOME/.deplate/" or "$USERPROFILE/deplate.rc/"{idx: deplate.rc}. If these 
directories are not found, the files are searched in ''$WINDIR/deplate.rc/'' 
or ''/etc/deplate.rc/''. Some files are also looked for in the "datadir" 
(usually something like ''/usr/share/deplate/'').

This directory may also contain custom modules or css files etc. On Win 
2000/XP  etc., $USERPROFILE is usually set to "C:\\Documents and 
Settings\\USERNAME\\".{text if=(manPage!=1):
\ See also{ref: extending} for how to add new elements, particles, macros 
etc.}
#configFile
#IDX: Elements|Element|element|elements
#IDX: Particles|particles|Particle|particle
#IDX: Macros|macros|Macro|macro
#IDX: CSS|css

The user configuration directory should look like this:

    - ~/.deplate/
        - config.rb (the general user configuration file, which is 
          loaded last)
        - deplate.ini (an alternative way to configure ''deplate'')
        - after/ (files that are loaded right after the corresponding 
          formatter or module)
            - fmt/
            - input/
            - mod/
        - css/ (user defined css files)
        - fmt/ (user defined formatters)
        - input/ (user defined input definitions)
        - lib/ (user defined ''deplate'' snippets)
            - FORMATTER/ (output-format specific ''deplate'' snippets)
        - mod/ (user defined modules)
        - templates/ (user defined templates)

If the user requests loading "MODULE", deplate searches for
"~/.deplate/mod/MODULE.rb" first, then in ruby site-library. If it was 
found and loaded, the file "~/.deplate/after/mod/MODULE.rb" will be 
sourced, too -- if available.

''deplate'' calls the class method ''Deplate::Core.user_setup'' after processing 
the command line argumend. It calls the instance method 
''Deplate#user_initialize'' after the new instance of the ''deplate'' 
converter was created and initialized, right before actually performing 
the conversion.

In general, configuration is done by patching ruby classes. In the 
following example, we

    - restrict the markers for unordered lists to "#"
    - define Koma-Script's article class as the default latex class
      #IDX: List|list|Lists|lists

#Code id=cfg1 syntax=ruby <<---
class Deplate::List::Itemize
    @rx = /^(([ \t]+)(#)[ \t]+)(.+)$/
end

class Deplate::Formatter::LaTeX
    @@latexDocClass = "scrartcl"
end
---
#IDX: Formatter|formatter

Here is another example from my personal "after/fmt/latex.rb" file.

#Code id=cfg2 syntax=ruby <<---
class Deplate::Formatter::LaTeX
    def hook_pre_prepare_my_configuration
        suppl   = @deplate.variables["suppl"]                    #1
        suppl &&= "[" + suppl + "]"
        output_at(:pre, :user_packages, "\\usepackage#{suppl}{suppl}")

        t = @deplate.get_clip("title")                           #2
        output_at(:pre, :body_title, "\\tmltitle{#{t.elt}}") if t
        a = @deplate.get_clip("author")
        output_at(:pre, :body_title, "\\tmlauthor{#{a.elt}}") if a
        d = @deplate.get_clip("date")
        output_at(:pre, :body_title, "\\tmldate{#{d.elt}}") if d
    end
end
---

    1. Add a usepackage statement to the preamble -- with optional arguments 
       from the "suppl" {text if=(manPage!=1) else=variable: 
       [[markup.txt#docCmd][variable]]}.
    2. extracts information about the document's title and author{text 
       if=manPage!=1: (see{ref: titleCmd})} and adds some user-defined 
       commands to the document preamble -- but below any usepackage 
       statements{text if=(manPage!=1): \ (see{ref: slotOpt})}.


** User configuration of the standard setup
#user_setup
#user_initialize

#AUTOIDX: user_setup; user_initialize
''deplate'' calls the methods ''Deplate::Core.user_setup(options)'' and 
''Deplate::Core#user_initialize'' if they are defined in order to provide a 
possibility to hook into the standard setup procedure.

''Deplate::Core.user_setup'' is called when starting ''deplate'' from the 
command line and before a instance of ''Deplate::Core'' was created. This 
method should be used to set values in the ''options'' structure {text 
if=manPage!=1: (see{ref: optionStruct})} or to permanently require one of 
''deplate'''s modules.

''Deplate::Core#user_initialize'' is called after an instance of 
''Deplate::Core'' was created and should be used to set variables specific to 
this instance.


#Code id=cfg_user_setup syntax=ruby <<---
class Deplate::Core
    def self.user_setup(options)
        options.field_name = 'some value'
        require_module(options, 'NAME')
    end

    def user_initialize
        @variables['NAME'] = 'VALUE'
    end
end
---



** Configuration of wiki names
#wikiNames

Usually, any word in \CamelCase (a.k.a. wiki name) is turned into a hyperlink. 
By default only the letters A-Z and a-z are allowed here in order to minimize 
possible conflicts between different encodings and different versions of ruby 
on different systems with different locales in effect. If this doesn't fit 
your needs, maybe because you happen to write in a language other than 
English, which is possible and maybe even likely, you might want to change 
this.  Add something like this with the new character sets to your 
''config.rb''{idx: config.rb} file:

#Code id=cfg3 syntax=ruby <<---
class Deplate::HyperLink
    @@uc = 'A-ZÄÖÜ'
    @@lc = 'a-zäöüßáàéèíìóòçñ'
end

# the following re-compiles the regexps for wiki names
Deplate::HyperLink.setup
---

If you really don't like simple wiki names and want to disable the all 
together, you can put something like this into your config.rb:

#Code id=disable_simple_names syntax=ruby <<---
class Deplate::Core
    def self.user_setup(options)
        options.disabled_particles << Deplate::HyperLink::Simple
    end
end
---


** Configuration via deplate.ini
#configuration

If you don't want to configure ''deplate'' using ruby, you can put some 
settings into the ''deplate.ini''{idx: deplate.ini} file, which usually 
resides in ''~/.depate'' and/or ''#{PWD}/deplate.rc''{idx: deplate.rc}{text 
if=manPage!=1:--but see{ref: Configuration}}. Themes can also have their own 
ini files.

This file contains a sequence of commands. Each command must fit in one line. 
The following commands are allowed:

    ''allow FLAGS''     :: Allow ''deplate'' to do certain things(see{ref: 
      allow})
        - If you use deplate only for your own files, you might want to run 
          deplate in "unsafe" mode by adding ''allow all'' to your deplate.ini 
          file.
    ''--OPTION''        :: Additional command line option
    ''mod NAME''        :: Load the module NAME
    ''fmt NAME''        :: Set the standard formatter
    ''clip NAME=VALUE'' :: Set the clip NAME (e.g., "author") to VALUE
    ''wiki NAME.SUFFIX=BASEURL'' :: Define an interwiki (the ''.SUFFIX'' part 
      is optional)
    ''wikichars UPPERCHARS LOWERCHARS'' :: Define which characters are allowed 
      in wiki names
        % !!! Wiki names must always begin with A-Z even then wiki chars were 
        %     redefined (at least until ruby's regexp library makes ''\\b'' 
        %     match properly against words starting with an international upper 
        %     case character)
    ''app NAME=COMMANDLINE'' :: Define an external app (e.g., latex, dvips, R, 
      dot, neato, pstoedit, identify, gs ...)
        - If you get a ''Exec format error'' error, this is probably caused by 
          a missing executable suffix. To avoid this error, redefine the app 
          and add a ''.exe'' or similar to the name.
    ''$ENV=VALUE''      :: Set an environment variable
    ''VAR=VALUE''       :: Set variable VAR to VALUE
        - Alternatively, variables can contain multi-line values using the 
          usual heredoc pattern (''<<MARKER\\nTEXT...\\nMARKER\\n'') as long 
          as the smaller characters ("<<") appear right after the equals sign.  
          Internally, a multi-line value is processed as array.

Although this may not always work as expected, you can also set some options 
{text if=(manPage!=1):(as defined in {ref: optionFields})} by prepending the 
name with a colon (":") or by using the ''option'' keyword:

    ''option NAME~''         :: Set option NAME to false
    ''option NAME!''         :: Set option NAME to true
    ''option NAME?=true|false|yes|no|on|off'' :: Set option NAME to a boolean value
    ''option NAME%=INTEGER'' :: Set option NAME to a numeric value
    ''option NAME=VALUE''    :: Set option NAME to VALUE as string

Lines beginning with one of ''*%#;'' are considered comments.

#IF: manPage!=1
** Options
#optionStruct

Most command line options correspond to fields in the (open) structure
''Deplate#options''. You could thus make your choices permanent by adding 
something like this to your ''config.rb''{idx: config.rb} configuration file:

#Code id=cfg4 syntax=ruby <<---
class Deplate::Core
    def self.user_setup(options)
        options.field_name = 'some value'           # ok
        options.allow_exec = true                   # example
    end

    def user_initialize
        @variables['NAME'] = 'VALUE'                # ok
        @options.other_field_name = 'some value'    # deprecated
    end
end
---

The variable ''options'' is meant to influence the whole setup and should 
contain variables that cannot be set directly by a document.  
''variables'' are meant to specific to the current conversion process.  
While ''options'' should be set in Deplate#user_setup, ''variables'' 
should be defined in Deplate#user_initialize.

Here is a mostly complete table of command line options and 
corresponding option fields:

|| Command line option        || Field names               ||
| -a, -\-[no-]ask              | ask_user = bool            |

| -A, --allow FLAGS            | allow = [FLAGS]            |
#optionFields
#IDX: PDF|pdf

The command-line option "-x" or "-\-allow-ruby [RUBY SAFE]" currently 
sets the class variable ''@@allow_ruby'' and the global variable 
''$SAFE'' (if an integer is provided). ''--verbose'' sets Deplate's 
class variable ''@@verbose''.
#ENDIF: manPage


** Templates
#templates

''deplate'' supports two ways of page templates:
    # Template variables
    # Template files

*** Template variables (obsolete)

You can define a template in ruby by setting the following Deplate class 
variables:

    - these variables (array of arrays of strings) can be redefined in 
      Deplate::Core.user_setup to put some formatted output on every page/file
        - ''@@pre_matter_template''
        - ''@@body_template''
        - ''@@post_matter_template''

    - this variable (array of strings) can contain some deplate markup 
      that will be prepended to every file read
        - ''@@deplate_template''

Typical use would be (in your ''config.rb''{idx: config.rb} file)

#Code id=cfg5 syntax=ruby <<--
class Deplate
    def self.user_setup(options)
        if options.fmt =~ /^html/
            @@post_matter_template[10] = ['<br>\n(c) 2004, Me']
        end
        @@deplate_template << '#AU: My Name'
    end
end
--


*** Template files
#templateFiles

Via the ''-t'' or ''--template'' command-line option or by setting the 
''template'' document variable{text if=(manPage!=1): \ (see{ref: docOpt})}, you 
can define simple text templates that will be filled in with content from your 
''deplate'' file.

Since version 0.7, ''deplate'' uses a specialized formatter for handling 
templates. Before 0.7, this was done by search & replace. If you have pre 0.7 
templates which don't work any more, you can switch back to the old template 
mechanism by setting the {text if=(manPage!=1) else=document option: 
[[markup.txt#docOpt][document option]]} ''template_version'' to 1.

In templates, only a small number of statements are available:

    Commands :: GET, ARG, XARG, VAR, OPT, PREMATTER, POSTMATTER, BODY, IF,

The commands PREMATTER, POSTMATTER, BODY as well as the Mingle region 
are specific to templates.
#IDX: #Mingle

PREMATTER, POSTMATTER, and BODY can be used to fill in formatted content {text 
if=manPage!=1: (see{ref: docstructure}} for an explanation of ''deplate'''s 
document structure):

    ''#PREMATTER''  :: The file header, the beginning of the document 
      definition, some text that in multi-file mode should appear in 
      every output file
    ''#BODY''       :: The text body
    ''#POSTMATTER'' :: Some text that in multi-file mode should appear 
      in every output file, the end of document definition

These commands take a list of slots (named or as numbers) as arguments{text 
if=manPage!=1: (see{ref: docstructure})}. The slots can be single slots or 
ranges. They can be positive (add selectively) or negative (add with the 
exception of certain content). Examples:

    ''#PREMATTER: -doc_def'' :: add the prematter without the document 
      type definition
    ''#PREMATTER: doc_def mod_packages mod_head'' :: add the document 
      type definition, and stuff added by modules
    ''#PREMATTER: head_beg..prematter_end'' :: add everything from the head on 
      downwards

A slot cannot be consumed twice. I.e., if you use several template 
commands, the latter will not insert the content that was already 
inserted by the previous command.

The Mingle region can be used to add some text to a specific slot in the 
original document. Filling in templates takes place after the document 
was produced. A template actually processed by deplate like normal text 
but with a different active rule set. Thus, if you define a slot or a 
type for a region in the template file these definitions refer to the 
template output which usually is not quite what you want. You can use 
Mingle to make them refer to the original document. See 
''html-left-tabbar-js.html'' in the ''templates'' subdirectory of the 
distribution for an example.

Curly braces in templates could cause problems because ''deplate'' maybe 
interpretes them as macros. If ''deplate'' mixes up your template, you should 
prefix these curly braces that cause problems with a backslash.

Backslashes have always to be doubled.


#EXAMPLE: A letter template

In this example, we use get for the author's name because the corresponding 
clip is automatically defined by the standard #AU(THOR) command. For other 
data we use variables.

Template: tmpl_letter.tex
#Verb <<---------
\\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,english]{letter}
#PREMATTER: -doc_def
\\address{{get: author}\\\\
    {val escapebackslash!: address}}
\\signature{{get: author}}

\\begin{letter}{{val: addresseeName}\\\\
    {val escapebackslash!: addresseeAddress}}
\\opening{Dear {val: addresseeName},}

#BODY

\\closing{Sincerly,}
\\vfill{}
\\encl{{val: enclosure}}
\\end{letter}
#POSTMATTER
---------

Input file: example-letter.txt
#Verb <<---------
#AU: John Smith
#DATE: today
#VAR id=address: Cool Place 1{nl inline!}Hiptown 10000
#VAR id=enclosure: Important Document
#VAR: addresseeName=Max Mustermann
#VAR: addresseeAddress=Tolle Straße 2{nl}Neustadt 20000

I would like to say thanks for your last letter which I read with much joy. I
hope to be hearing from you soon.
